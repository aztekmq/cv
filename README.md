MQ ENGINEER
PNC Bank
08/2022 - 08/2024
Remote
As MQ Engineer, I developed all PNC's existing MQ Single & RDQM-HA (1200+ Qmgrs) automation utilizing their DevOps model. This included writing Ansible playbooks/roles/tasks, custom Python MQ modules and bash scripting.Developed pipeline based automation leveraging REST API to integrate MQ to multiple Enterprise systems: Venafi (cert mgmt), TrueSight Middleware (admin), Dynatrace (alert/monitoring). I developed a monthly O/S patching solution for RDQM-HA RHEL instances, which incorporated O/S Patching with kmod-drbd patching in a rolling manner, that kept the Qmgr available and running. 
 - Developed all lifecycle automation for MQ including patching, upgrades, downgrades, backups, kernel tuning, performance testing, cloning, MQSC deployments.
 - Developed automation that periodically downloads IBM KMOD-DRBD compatibility JSON data and integrates into html/javascript, then post into a Confluence page that provides a convenient method to check compatibility.
 - Created several custom python3 tools: mqDiff.py, poi-healthCheck.py, query-server.py, migrate-truesight-to-dynatrace.py, mqConfig-Event.py, post2Confluence.py, trebuchet.py.
 - Developed several MQ HTML/Javascript based Widgets Confluence: MQ Disk Space Calculator, MQ RAM/CPU & Kernel Tuning Calculator.In Confluence, I created over 400 MQ Web-based FlashCards Questions to assist with learning MQ.
 - Used opensource mqexporter.go utility and converted it to python3, and instead of pushing to Prometheus, converted to push to Dynatrace.
